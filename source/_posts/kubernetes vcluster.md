> vCluster is a technology that creates virtual clusters within a physical Kubernetes cluster. These virtual clusters are fully functional and provide enhanced isolation and flexibility for multi-tenancy. Each vCluster operates independently, with its own API server and control plane, while sharing the underlying resources of the host cluster.
>
> Kubernetes serves as the foundational platform for container orchestration, while vCluster enhances its capabilities by providing isolated, virtualized environments for multi-tenant applications. This relationship allows organizations to maximize resource utilization and maintain security across diverse teams and applications

## Key Features of vCluster

- **Isolation**: Each virtual cluster has its own control plane, enhancing security and minimizing conflicts among teams.
- **Resource Management**: Virtual clusters manage their resources independently, allowing for efficient scaling and resource utilization.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Supports multiple teams or tenants operating within the same physical infrastructure without interference.
- **Flexibility**: Can run on various Kubernetes distributions and supports different backing stores for data management.

## Relationship Between Kubernetes and vCluster

- **Foundation**: vCluster is built on top of Kubernetes, leveraging its capabilities to provide additional layers of abstraction and isolation.
- **Resource Sharing**: While vClusters share the physical resources of the host Kubernetes cluster, they maintain operational independence, allowing teams to work without affecting the global state of the host cluster.
- **Enhanced Security**: vClusters provide granular permissions and isolated control planes, which enhance security compared to standard Kubernetes namespaces.
- **Operational Efficiency**: By reducing the load on the host cluster's API server and allowing independent management of resources, vClusters improve overall operational efficiency.
